# Requirements

Motif analysis was performed with the Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT, <http://rsat.eu>). This software suite can be used on the Web server or downloaded and installed on Unix-like operating systems (Linux, Mac OS X).

A ready-to-use RSAT server can also be downloaded in the form of a Virtualbox virtual machine, which can run on Linux, Windows or Mac OS X. 

The motif analyses can be reproduced with the following steps: 

- download and install the VirtualBox sofwtare
- download RSAT Virtual Machine (RSAT-VM)
